## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to achieve consistent UI across the Mess Management System, with particular focus on fixing header duplication and maintaining consistent styling between student and receptionist interfaces.

## Changes Made

- Ensured the Navbar appears across all pages with the same styling

### 2. UI Element Standardization
- Applied consistent background styling to the Profile page to match other pages
- Updated card components to have consistent styling across the application
- Standardized colors to match the existing design system (using rgba(13, 27, 42, X) as base)
- Enhanced profile page elements to match the existing UI aesthetics

### 3. Header Duplication Fix
